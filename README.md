# Steam-scale
Steam scale This is my first demo game, and it can be said to be my first game. This is a game about scales. The villains and bricks kept falling from above. You need to grab them and place them on the scale. Build a house with bricks to prevent the villain from falling. But it's so difficult, I can't play it by myself anyway. The game is built through Construct3. When exporting, only the background color is displayed. I don’t know if it’s just my computer and mobile phone. If you can't open the game, please use Construct3 to open the project source file and click Preview to start the game normally. If you find the reason for the wrong export file, you are welcome to tell me, thank you.

This game is a work I participated in at Ludum Dare 49, but there was a problem when exporting it, and it can only be opened with the game engine. Fortunately, this engine can be run directly on the Internet for free, so it can be considered a successful participation.
However, because of the export problem, it took a lot of time and the game production process was stuck, resulting in no background, more gameplay could not be realized, and no time to do more scenes.
But it's fun anyway.
This is the Ludum Dare 49 link for this game: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/steamscale
If you know how to solve the export problem, you are welcome to let me know.
